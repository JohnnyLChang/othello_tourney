    File specification
  </h3>
  <p>
    <span class='output'>Othello_Core.py</span> is the template file that all students will have access to. You can access it from you code using <span class='output'>import Othello_Core</span>. It lays out the basic constants and a class that all student submissions must inherit from, and methods that must be overwritten. 
   </p>
   <p>
    Students must create a file called <span class='output'>strategy.py</span> with a class called <span class='output'>Strategy</span> (optionally inheriting from <span class='output'>Othello_Core.OthelloCore</span>) and containing a method called <span class='output'>best_strategy</span> taking the arguments <span class='output'>board, player, best_move, still_running</span> in that order. <span class='output'>best_move</span> and <span class='output'>still_running</span> are <span class='output'>multiprocessing.Value</span> objects, and can be changed using <span class='output'>best_move.value=34</span> for example. <span class='output'>still_running</span> is a flag turned to 0 when the code is about to be killed.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a quick example, here is the most basic form of AI, random choice:
    <pre class='output'>
import Othello_Core as core
import random

class Strategy(core.OthelloCore):
    # implement all the required methods on your own
    def best_strategy(self, board, player, best_move, running):
        best_move.value = random.choice(self.legal_moves(board, player))
    </pre>
  </p>
  <!-- h3>
    Multiple files
  </h3>
  <p>
    All your files are accessible in <span class='output'>remote.tjhsst.edu:/web/activities/othello/private/Students/{your_name}</span>. You can add more files there using the <span class='output'>scp</span> command, or edit them if you want to make quick changes. All files will be accessible like normal, using <span class='output'>import extra_file</span> or <span class='output'>f = open('./extra_file.pkl')</span>
  </p !-->

    Other Info
  </h3>
  <p>
    If you code fails to return a move, returns an invalid move, or errors for whatever reason, it will be treated as a forfeit. As such, make sure you code works on your computer before using this website to test against other ais. Just as a reminder, if your code is caught cheating during the tournament in any way, you <b>will</b> be caught and given an integrity violation, so just don't do it.
